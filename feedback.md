:------------- | :-------------
**Core Requirements** |
Git hygiene | 
Comprehension questions | 
**Functionality** |
Click a button to load and view a list of trips | 
Clicking the "load" button twice does not cause each trip to display twice | 
Click a trip to load and view trip details | 
Clicking a different trip loads different details | 
Fill out a form to reserve a spot | 
Errors are reported to the user | 
Site is clearly laid out and easy to navigate | 
**Under the Hood** |
Callback functions are not nested more than 2 levels deep | 
Callback functions are given descriptive names | 
Code is generally well-organized and easy to read | 
All API calls have both success and error callbacks defined | 
Optional but recommended: closures are used to keep track of which trip is selected | 
HTML is semantic | 
CSS is DRY, uses CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or Bootstrap | 
**Overall** |
